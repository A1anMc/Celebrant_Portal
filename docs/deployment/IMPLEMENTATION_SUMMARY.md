```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Organization API: 500 per hour
# Premium tier: 2000 per hour
```

**Integration**:
```python
from rate_limiter import init_limiter, auth_rate_limit

limiter = init_limiter(app)

@app.route('/login')
@limiter.limit(auth_rate_limit())
def login():
    # Rate limited login endpoint
```

- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Complete CI/CD pipeline

**Pipeline Features**:
- ✅ Multi-stage testing (unit, integration, security)
- ✅ Code quality checks (black, flake8, mypy)
- ✅ Security scanning (bandit, safety, Trivy)
- ✅ Docker multi-platform builds (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- ✅ Automated staging deployment
- ✅ Zero-downtime production deployment
- ✅ Database backup and migration
- ✅ Slack notifications

**Docker Stack**:
```yaml
services:
  app:        # Flask application (Gunicorn)
  db:         # PostgreSQL 15
  redis:      # Redis for caching/rate limiting
  nginx:      # Reverse proxy (production)
  worker:     # Celery background tasks
  scheduler:  # Celery beat scheduler
```

**CI/CD Workflow**:
1. **Test**: Code quality, unit tests, security scanning
2. **Build**: Multi-platform Docker images
3. **Deploy Staging**: Automated deployment to staging
4. **Deploy Production**: Zero-downtime production deployment
5. **Migrate**: Database migrations

### 5. 🚀 Flask 3.x Migration Strategy

**Status**: ✅ **PLANNING COMPLETE**

**Files Created**:
- `FLASK_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive migration strategy

**Migration Plan**:
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Preparation (Week 1) - Code audit, testing, documentation
- ✅ **Phase 2**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 Migration (Week 2) - Model updates, query syntax
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Flask 3.x Core Migration (Week 3) - Core framework upgrade
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Extension Updates (Week 4) - Flask extension compatibility
- ✅ **Phase 5**: Testing & Validation (Week 5) - Comprehensive testing

**Key Changes Identified**:
```python
# SQLAlchemy 2.0 Changes
# OLD: Column definitions
id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)

# NEW: Mapped annotations
id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)

# Flask 3.x Changes
# OLD: app.config['JSON_SORT_KEYS'] = False
# NEW: app.json.sort_keys = False
```

**Risk Assessment**: Medium risk with comprehensive rollback procedures

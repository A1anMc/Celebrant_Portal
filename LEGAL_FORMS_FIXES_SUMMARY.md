# Legal Forms Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Template Syntax Error in Couples View
**Problem**: Missing `{% endif %}` tag in `templates/couples/view.html` causing Jinja2 template syntax error.

**Solution**: Added the missing `{% endif %}` tag after the travel information section.

**Location**: `templates/couples/view.html` around line 200

### 2. Legal Forms Data Structure Mismatch
**Problem**: Template was expecting fields that weren't being provided by the service:
- `form.is_mandatory` 
- `form.template_available`
- `form.legal_deadline` (was returning `form.deadline`)

**Solution**: Updated `LegalFormsService.get_couple_forms_status()` method to include all required fields:
- Added `'is_mandatory': form_info.get('mandatory', False)`
- Added `'template_available': form_info.get('template_available', False)`
- Added `'legal_deadline': form.legal_deadline` (kept both for compatibility)

**Location**: `legal_forms_service.py` lines 360-375

### 3. Compliance Score Access
**Problem**: Template was accessing `data.compliance_score` but the data structure had it nested under `data.couple.compliance_score`.

**Solution**: Template was already correctly accessing `data.couple.compliance_score`, but the service needed to ensure the data structure was consistent.

## Files Modified

1. **`templates/couples/view.html`**
   - Fixed missing `{% endif %}` tag

2. **`legal_forms_service.py`**
   - Enhanced `get_couple_forms_status()` method to include all required fields
   - Added `is_mandatory`, `template_available`, and `legal_deadline` fields

Subject: Vow Reminder - Let's Make This Personal! 📝💕

Dear {{ partner1_name }} and {{ partner2_name }},

I hope wedding planning is going smoothly! I wanted to send you a gentle reminder about your wedding vows.

💭 DON'T PANIC - THIS IS NORMAL!

If you're anything like 95% of couples, you might be thinking:
• "We haven't started our vows yet"
• "We don't know what to say"
• "What if we're not good writers?"
• "What if we cry and can't get through them?"

GOOD NEWS: You don't need to be Shakespeare! The most beautiful vows are simple, heartfelt, and authentic to YOU.

✍️ GETTING STARTED:

Here are some questions to spark ideas:

🎯 ABOUT YOUR PARTNER:
• What made you fall in love with them?
• What's your favorite thing about them?
• How do they make you feel safe/loved/happy?
• What's a funny or sweet memory you share?

🎯 ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP:
• What have you learned about love from being together?
• How have you grown as a person since being with them?
• What challenges have you overcome together?

🎯 ABOUT YOUR FUTURE:
• What are you most excited about in married life?
• What promises do you want to make to them?
• What dreams do you share?

📏 PRACTICAL TIPS:

✅ Length: Aim for 1-2 minutes (about 200-300 words)
✅ Tone: Match each other's style (both funny, both serious, or both mixed)
✅ Structure: Start with why you love them, add a story, make promises for the future
✅ Practice: Read them out loud to yourself - if you cry, that's perfect!

📝 SIMPLE STRUCTURE:

1. "{{ partner_name }}, when I think about you, I..."
2. "I love the way you..."
3. "One of my favorite memories is when..."
4. "I promise to..."
5. "I choose you because..."

💡 EXAMPLES TO INSPIRE YOU:

Instead of: "You're my everything"
Try: "You're the person who makes me laugh when I'm taking myself too seriously"

Instead of: "I love you so much"
Try: "I love how you always leave me little notes in my lunch"

🎭 DIFFERENT STYLES:

• ROMANTIC: Focus on feelings, dreams, and romantic promises
• FUNNY: Include inside jokes, quirky habits, and light-hearted promises
• SPIRITUAL: Reference your shared values, growth, and deeper connection
• PRACTICAL: Focus on partnership, teamwork, and life goals

📱 NEED HELP? I'M HERE!

If you're stuck, don't hesitate to:
• Send me a draft - I can help refine it
• Ask for specific examples
• Schedule a call to brainstorm
• Get tips on delivery and managing nerves

⏰ TIMELINE:

• Final version: 1 week before wedding
• Practice reading: Few days before

Remember, there's no "wrong" way to write vows. The magic is in the sincerity, not the perfection!

📧 WHAT TO DO NEXT:

1. Set aside 30 minutes this week to jot down thoughts
2. Don't worry about perfect wording - just get ideas down
3. Send me your first draft when you're ready
4. We'll polish them together!

Your vows are going to be beautiful because they're coming from your heart. I can't wait to hear what you write!

With encouragement and excitement,

P.S. Some couples choose to write them together, others prefer to surprise each other. Both approaches are wonderful - do what feels right for you! 💕

## **üìä Performance Optimization**

### **1. Database Optimization**
```sql
-- Regular maintenance queries
ANALYZE users, couples, ceremonies, invoices;
VACUUM ANALYZE;
REINDEX DATABASE celebrant_portal;

-- Monitor slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time, calls 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY mean_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### **2. Cache Optimization**
```python
# Monitor cache performance
cache_hit_rate = cache_hits / (cache_hits + cache_misses)
target_hit_rate = 0.8  # 80%

# Optimize cache keys
- Use consistent naming
- Set appropriate TTL
- Monitor memory usage
```
